# Actuarial Simulation Models: Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Applications

## 🎯 Project Objective

This repository showcases quantitative simulation models developed in Python, focusing on core concepts essential to actuarial science, risk management, and financial analysis. The primary goal is to demonstrate the ability to construct stochastic models from foundational principles to solve complex probability problems and model sequential processes.

The project includes two primary types of simulations:

1.  **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Used to determine the frequentist probability of discrete events (e.g., the likelihood of obtaining a specific outcome over repeated trials, as seen in the die roll problem).
2.  **Markov Chains Modeling:** Utilized for approximating transition probabilities across successive states over time (relevant for credit risk, modeling insurance claims, or operational risk analysis).

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Utilized

The analysis was implemented in a Python environment (Jupyter/Colab) using:

* **`numpy`**: Essential for efficient numerical computation, vector operations, and high-volume random number generation.
* **`random`**: Direct implementation of the Monte Carlo simulation to derive frequentist probabilities.
* **`matplotlib`**: Used for visualizing the convergence of empirical probability towards the theoretical probability as the number of simulations increases.

## 📊 Demonstrated Value and Methodologies

The core value of this project is the mastery of rigorous simulation methodologies:

1.  **Law of Large Numbers Application:** Implementing high-frequency iterative processes (N = 100,000 simulations) to confirm the stability of empirical probabilities.
2.  **Stochastic Process Modeling:** The algorithms (particularly the Markov Chain components) exhibit a strong understanding of time-discrete processes critical for:
    * **Credit Risk:** Modeling credit rating migration.
    * **Insurance Liability:** Projecting the frequency and timing of future claims (Siniestralidad).
    * **Financial Derivatives Valuation:** Using simulation to value complex options and derivatives.

## ✨ Competencies Showcased.

* **Advanced Python Skills** in a structured development environment (Jupyter).
* **Structured Quantitative Thinking** required for translating complex mathematical and actuarial problems into clean, scalable code.
* Immediate ability to contribute to **financial and actuarial modeling tasks** within the team.
